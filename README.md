# -Lane-Departure-Warning-System-LDWS-C-Simulation
This project simulates a basic Level 1 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) feature — the Lane Departure Warning System — using C++. The system detects whether a vehicle is drifting out of its lane based on simulated lane sensors and triggers warnings accordingly.
